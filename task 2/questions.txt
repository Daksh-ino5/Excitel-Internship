1. Multi-Key VLOOKUP using Pandas
You have two CSV files: 'employee_details.csv' and 'employee_salary.csv'. Both contain
'Name' and 'DOB' columns. Perform a VLOOKUP using both columns as keys to fetch the
salary for each employee in the 'employee_details' file.

2. Fuzzy Matching VLOOKUP
You have two CSV files: 'customers_a.csv' and 'customers_b.csv' with customer names.
Match names from A to the closest name in B using fuzzy matching.

3. Left Join with Missing Data Handling
You have 'products.csv' and 'price_list.csv'. Perform a left join to bring in prices. If price is
missing, fill with 'Not Available'.

4. Reverse Lookup using Pandas
You have 'employee_codes.csv' and a list of employee codes. Lookup employee names
based on codes.
